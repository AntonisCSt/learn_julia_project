## Project of the week Julia

### Why learn julia?

Julia allows you to call Python, C, and Fortran libraries directly. You get to enjoy a similar-to-C performance with fewer lines of code. Julia can handle complex data analysis tasks easily. It has native machine learning and deep learning packages for larger and more complex models.

### Basic cheat sheet:

Running a julia file in terminal (assuming path is set):
`julia Hello_world.jl`
